**Objectives:** 
- SWE's and SRE's can easily monitor health of DB queries from the perspective of services talking to the database
- SWEs can drill down to sepecific queries to optimize performance

View list of supported databases [here](/about-pixie/data-sources#supported-protocols).

**Example Questions:** 
- _"Are we making redundant queries?"_
- _"Is there a class of queries that are really slow?"_
- _"What are all the services that talk to the database?"_

**Interactive Tutorial:**
